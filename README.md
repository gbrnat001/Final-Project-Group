# Final-proj-Group2

We will be simulating a fire moving through a forested area. Each cell in the grid would 
be a square foot of ground that could be on fire, ash, empty/dirt, or have some type of 
plant. Fire can spread between plants and burn through them to make ash depending on wind
 speed, humidity, how dry the vegetation is. The user would input their 
 desired wind speed, humidity, the amount of initial fire which will be used to start the fire.
