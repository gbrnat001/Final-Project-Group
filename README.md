# Final-proj-Group2

We will be simulating a fire moving through a forested area. Each cell in the grid would 
be a square foot of ground that could be on fire, ash, empty/dirt, or have some type of 
plant. Fire can spread between plants and burn through them to make ash depending on wind
 direction/speed, humidity, and gaps between vegetation. The user would input their 
 desired wind speed and direction, humidity, the amount of initial fire, and the amount 
 of vegetation.
